  The Paper ECG application&amp;rsquo;s interface   The Paper ECG application enables cardiology professionals to convert digital scans or images of ECG print outs to digital signal data, and is the first free and open source application to provide such functionality. Users annotate the image with rectangular regions to mark where each signal is located and specify the scale information and the application handles the rest of the process to create accurate digital signals.</description>

      <description>Witchcraft&amp;rsquo;s interface   A fully equipped software synthesizer built with Max/MSP. Includes 2 wavetable synthesizes which allow drawing waveforms directly on the interface. Both wavetables come with FM controllers. Also includes 2 basic oscillators, a physical modeling oscillator, a harmonic oscillator and 2 noise sources. The generators and the filters are laid out to intuitively show the signal flow. At the bottom are the modulators and effects are along the side.</description>
