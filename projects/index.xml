      <description>The Paper ECG interface   This application provides tools for cardiology professionals to digitize digital scans or images of ECG print outs, and is the first free and open source application to provide such functionality. Users can annotate regions of the image to extra signal data and specify the scale information to create an accurate digitization of the signals. The digitization processes are implementations of peer-reviewed ECG signal digitization algorithms.</description>

      <description>Witchcraft&amp;rsquo;s interface   A fully equipped software synthesizer built with Max/MSP. Includes 2 wavetable synthesizes which allow drawing waveforms directly on the interface. Both wavetables come with FM controllers. Also includes 2 basic oscillators, a physical modeling oscillator, a harmonic oscillator and 2 noise sources. The generators and the filters are laid out to intuitively show the signal flow. At the bottom are the modulators and effects are along the side.</description>
